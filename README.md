# Rust + C â†’ Wasm explorations [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/wehlutyk/wasm-explorations.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/wehlutyk/wasm-explorations)

**Note:** I do not maintain this repo any more, and at least example 5 is currently failing (see [#2](https://github.com/wehlutyk/wasm-explorations/issues/2)).

"Hello world"s progressing from pure Rust to Rust with various degrees of C libraries, all compiled to Wasm.
